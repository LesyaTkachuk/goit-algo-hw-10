The optimal total max production amount is 50 units, that consists of 30 units of lemonad and 20 units of fruit juice.

# Task 2.
To find integral value of the function f(x)=4x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x + 9 means to calculate an area of the next complex figure bounded by the given function curve.

As we can see Monte-Carlo method gives us quit accurate result. Moreover it's accuracy increases with the number of points and experiments. 
We can visualize Monte-Carlo method for given task solving for 1_000 points:
